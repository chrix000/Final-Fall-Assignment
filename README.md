How My Sensor Works

This sensor is a rotary encoder, and it sends signals to the Arduino whenever you turn it. The Arduino reads these signals and uses them to figure out which direction the knob is moving.

Turning the knob to the right makes the number on the Arduino go up (positive).

Turning the knob to the left makes the number go down (negative).

The encoder also has a button built into the knob, so when you press it down, the Arduino can detect that too.
